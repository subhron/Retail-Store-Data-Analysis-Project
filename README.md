# Retail-Store-Data-Analysis-Project

Project Details:

In this project I have cleaned Retail store sales data and represented the the data using pivot charts in Excel answering questions such as:
1. What are the top five states with most sales?
2. Which distribution channels are most effectively contributing to sales? and etc.

To conclude, I have also added slicers for Channel, categories and month for ease of access for further inspection and visualization.


Insights Found:

1. Women are more inclined towards making purchases compared to men, constituting approximately 65% of the customer base.

2. The top three states in terms of sales are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, collectively contributing around 35% of the total sales.

3. The adult age group, particularly individuals aged between 30 to 49 years, makes the highest contribution to sales, accounting for approximately 50% of total purchases.

4. Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra are the primary sales channels, accounting for about 80% of total sales.

Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing: Direct marketing efforts towards women customers, particularly those within the age range of 30 to 49 years, residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.

Tailored Offers: Design and promote special offers, discounts, and coupons specifically targeted towards the identified demographic segments through channels like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
